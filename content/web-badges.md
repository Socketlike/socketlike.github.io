# web badges are neat
<p class="github-only">
  <b>hi curious github user skimming through my page's source code</b>
  <br>
  this markdown document may not be displayed properly because i have added custom """formatting""" that regular or github markdown doesn't have
  <br>
  consider viewing this document on my github pages instead!
</p>

for those who don't know what they are, here's [a definition of what a web badge is](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_badge), courtesy of wikipedia:

> *Web badges, buttons or stickers are small images on web pages, typically part of the footer. They can be used for promotion, stating compliance with web standards or to comply with an application's terms of service.*

and here's [a list of them, linking to pages on neocities](https://neonaut.neocities.org/cyber/88x31). pretty neat, huh?

after seeing that i really really wanted to make my own;\
so i did! here it is: [-mutter (sorry if its low effort i made it in 2 minutes with aseprite)]

[![evie's pages: blog](/badge.png)](https://evie.is-a.dev)

[-mutter (edit)] of course the badge would be useless without an embed code so here they are:
- html:
    ```html
    <a href="{origin}">
        <img
            alt="evie's pages: blog"
            src="{origin}/badge.png"
        >
    </a>
    ```
- markdown:
    ```md
    [![evie's pages: blog]({origin}/badge.png)]({origin})
    ```

i DO wanna make a better one some day.\
[-mutter maybe tomorrow,\
maybe never.\
we'll see...]
