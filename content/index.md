# hi i'm evie

do you know me? i probably don't know you. no one ever checks these webpages anyways! why do i bother..\
\
anyways, again, i'm **evie**. am <span placeholder="age"></span> year old.\
i'm a girl that really really loves procrastination. chronically tired, occasionally wired.\
\
because of that i haven't been doing anything of value.\
i'd just randomly get an idea for something cool and get in the mood to make it happen\
<span class="rapid">and then put it off immediately</span> because i'm *"doing something else"* or just don't have time for it.\
\
then later when i do have time, i'm just not in the mood anymore. so nothing ever ends up happening.\
\
i used to be obsessed with tinkering with web technologies but i've lost interest since a while ago (probably for the same reason?)\
\
\
it's a miracle i'm even making this webpage right now .
> *hey evie! hi evie! isn't this supposed to be the index page? where's the list of pages?*

shut the <span class="angry">HELL</span> up! <span class="mutter">when did i ever let YOU speak? who even are you? get out of here!!!</span> **anyways** they're on that sidebar on the top left .\
i don't have a good design for a nav thingy yet so you get that for now.

> *why is this webpage so damn empty?? blahblahblahblah*

<span class="angry">BECAUSE I HAVEN'T FIGURED OUT WHAT TO ADD YET OKAY SHUTUP</span>\
whoops lost my composure there! anyways this webpage is to remain mostly empty until i figure out what to add to it. goodbye!

> *but you haven't told me anything meaningful about yourself yet!*

i'm chronically online! you can almost always reach me through discord <span class="mutter">(encyclopedic)</span>.\
\
you can also find me on *minecraft* <span class="mutter">(sillyevie)</span>.\
yes i **DO** play minecraft sometimes. yes i play on hypixel.\
\
you **CAN** also find me on roblox <span class="mutter">(daydreamyevie)</span>\
note that i do not have my joins on and if you friend me randomly there is a non zero but **VERY** low chance that i will hear you out.\
\
i loop [this spotify playlist](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/7Gfvs4A320zPRQG1DG51nx) almost daily. infact i'm having it play right now.\

<span class="rapid">kthxforreadingallofthisgoodbye!</span>
