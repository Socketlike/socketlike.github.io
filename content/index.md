# hi i'm evie

do you know me? i probably don't know you. no one ever checks these webpages anyways! why do i bother..\
\
anyways, again, my name is *evelyn nightshade*, it's a really odd name, but it's [one i gave myself](https://youtube.com/watch?v=eoq2e4h_avs). if that's a mouthful for you, you can call me *evie*. anyways, moving on with the introductions.\
am {age} years old.\
i'm a girl who really really loves procrastination. chronically tired, occasionally wired.\
\
because of that i haven't been doing anything of value.\
i'd just randomly get an idea for something cool and get in the mood to make it happen\
[-rapid and then put it off immediately] because i'm *"doing something else"* or just don't have time for it.\
\
then later when i do have time, i'm just not in the mood anymore. so nothing ever ends up happening.\
\
i used to be obsessed with tinkering with web technologies but i've lost interest since a while ago (probably for the same reason?)\
\
\
it's a miracle i'm even making this webpage right now .
> *hey evie! hi evie! isn't this supposed to be the index page? where's the list of pages?*

shut the [-angry HELL] up! [-mutter when did i ever let YOU speak? who even are you? get out of here!!!]\
**anyways** they're on that sidebar on the top left .\
i don't have a good design for a nav thingy yet so you get that for now.

> *why is this webpage so damn empty?? blahblahblahblah*

[-angry because i haven't figured out what to add yet okay shut UP you're so-]\
whoops lost my composure there! anyways this webpage is to remain mostly empty until i figure out what to add to it. goodbye!

> *but you haven't told me anything meaningful about yourself yet!*

i'm chronically online! you can almost always reach me through discord [-mutter (encyclopedic)].\
\
you can also find me on *minecraft* [-mutter (sillyevie)].\
yes i **DO** play minecraft sometimes. yes i play on hypixel.\
\
you **CAN** also find me on roblox [-mutter (daydreamyevie)]\
note that i do not have my joins on and if you friend me randomly there is a non zero but **VERY** low chance that i will hear you out.\
\
here's a post about [what music i listen to](/music). you can also click on it on the nav panel.
