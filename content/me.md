just a couple hours ago as of the time writing this post {timestamp 1770719731552},\
i have destroyed almost if not all of the builds of an old "housing" of mine,\
[-mutter (a <a href="https://minecraft.net">minecraft</a> building plot world thing with a limited size hosted on the <a href="https://hypixel.net">hypixel network</a>, sorta like those "creative" worlds sometimes seen on minecraft servers)]\
solely because i wanted more space for building.

the reason why i chose to destroy this "housing" was because i was completely maxed out on the amount of "housings" that i could have, and this "housing" was... pretty abandoned.\
no one joined it, no one cared about it [-mutter (or so i thought)]... it was just there.

during the destruction i have chosen to preserve some of the builds only because i thought my girlfriend [-mutter (yes i have a girlfriend. yes i'm a lesbian.)] would miss them if they were gone.\
when she found out just a little bit later she was quite upset with me for... simply just destroying.\
she didn't really care that i saved the builds that i thought she cared about,\
she was just upset.

when i asked her why was she upset,\
she simply responded with something like\
"i had fun memories here"\
"you destroyed history"

granted i didn't think much of it at the time\
but i did eventually realize what she was on about\
*it didn't really matter that i saved some builds*.\
i didn't save the entire thing. like, ***the entire thing***.

all of the blocks\
they had at least some history to them\
even if i were to rebuild it\
it wouldn't be **the same thing**.

it would just be *a replica*.

why was i so unreluctant to the destruction?\
why did i truly think my creations had no meaning to them?\
sure, none of my creations have ever done anything significant to anyone\
but\
at least they *existed*.

i guess the actions of oneself really does speak up about the personality of themselves\
i truly felt nothing during the destruction of this minecraft world

nothing.\
***nothing at all.***

it's starting to scare me now\
how empty i am

the damage is done\
there is no coming back

all i can do now\
[-mutter is hope that i don't make the same mistakes.]
