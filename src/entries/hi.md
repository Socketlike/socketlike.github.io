hi! welcome to-

ugh, screw it. i'm tired of writing introductions and i have never been good at them anyways.

this is the first entry in this <span v-tooltip="'weblog. why is it shortened to blog and not something like wlog?'">blog</span>.

and i have to be honest: i have nothing on my mind to say right now.

i'm awfully exhausted and my brain is mush right now.  
it's a miracle that i'm even awake enough to write this.

this "blog" implementation, or as i like to call it, "entries", is heavily rushed.  
the code behind it is _a mess_. see [this](https://github.com/Socketlike/socketlike.github.io/tree/main/src/entries/index.ts) and [this](https://github.com/Socketlike.github.io/tree/main/src/views/EntriesView.vue) <span v-tooltip="'i am guessing these urls ahead of time so they might be wrong'">(!)</span>

i'm just glad i was able to make it as convenient and dynamic as possible.

the only thing i need to do is just to create a new markdown file in the entries folder, write some stuff in it, push it to github, and that's _basically it_.

thank god for markdown, and even more for [vite](https://vitejs.dev) and it's ecosystem.

the only quirk i've seen by doing this is that `vite dev` seems to not react to the changes to the markdown files.

if anyone knows how to fix this please tell me.

that's it. good bye, _for now_. there will probably be more "entries" like this in the future, so if you're interested in my rants and ramblings, feel free to, uh, check back _every day_?

wait, every day is a bit too _obsessive_.

maybe bi-daily? weekly? bi-weekly? monthly? bi-monthly?

_yearly_?

ugh, well, it doesn't really matter. you can do whatever you want.

anyways, good bye.
